# To-do-List:
This is a To-do list where you can strore your daily works in an order, and later can updated when the task is done.
I used python functions, conditional statements, data structures while building this project.
This is a very effective project for the people who troubles to maintain their schedule accordingly and who forget their tasks, they can easily store the tasks one by one in this project.
