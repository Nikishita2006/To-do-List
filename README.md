# To-do-List:
This is a To-do list where you can strore your daily works in an order, and later can update when the task is done.
I used python functions, conditional statements, data structures while building this project.
This is a very effective project for the people who get trouble  maintaining their schedule accordingly and the people who forget their tasks, they can easily store the tasks one by one in this project.
